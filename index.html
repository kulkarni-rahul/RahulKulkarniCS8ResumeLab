        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi! Iâ€™m Rahul Kulkarni, a second-year student at the University of California, Riverside majoring in economics and minoring in data science. The primary way the state regulates the food I eat is through the Food and Drug Administration. This is the federal agency that is responsible for determining what is and is not allowed to be sold in public markets, and are the ones who mandate that a nutrition label be present on all food products that I purchase. I find this to be very helpful, as I try to make a conscious effort to be aware exactly what kinds of food I am consuming, so consulting the nutritional label provides me with valuable information such as the calories, protein, sodium, and more that the food contains. The FDA also reaches to restaurants to regulate what they sell. They occasionally test food products, so if, for example, a business claims that its food is non-gmo, I can be assured that this is indeed the case because if it werenâ€™t, the FDAâ€™s tests would expose it. Another aspect that the state controls is waste disposal: nowadays, there are opportunities for businesses to get paid to recycle, which provides a greater incentive to do so, and ultimately helps clean up the environment.<br><br>

        When it comes to reusing and recycling plastics, I honestly think I do a pretty good job at that already. Part of the reason for this could be that both my parents grew up in rural areas, and my mother even grew up on a farm, so they know firsthand how devastating the effects of pollution can be, and have therefore always pushed me to be conscious of how I use plastics. I have always looked for ways to reuse my plastic items, and when I canâ€™t reuse them, I always recycle. The category that I could most improve in is reducing my plastic usage. Now that Iâ€™m reflecting on how I use plastics, Iâ€™ve realized that although I always reuse and recycle, I havenâ€™t made a significant effort to actually use less plastic. The easiest way for me to use less plastic would be to simply buy less things, as this would eliminate plastic wrapping from my life (this also has to do with consumerism). To take this further to live a day without plastics, besides buying less things, I would also have to make sure that none of my containers are plastic, and that I donâ€™t use any plastic tools throughout the day. This definitely seems like a hefty challenge and Iâ€™m not sure I could keep it up once a week, so I think Iâ€™ll try to do this once a month.<br><br>

        My hobbies include playing tennis, playing basketball, playing football, playing soccer, watching tennis, watching basketball, watching soccer, watching football, cooking good food, eating good food, walking, running, biking, playing video games such as clash royale, brawl stars, speedrunners, and trivial pursuit. My favorite television series include Bojack Horseman, Atlanta, Regular Show, Archer, Rick and Morty, Ramy, Silicon Valley, Tom and Jerry, and Ted Lasso. My favorite feature films include Finding Nemo, The Lion King, The Shawshank Redemption, Cars, Kill Bill Volume One, Kill Bill Volume Two, The Social Network, Pulp Fiction, Home Alone, Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse, No Country for Old Men, Whiplash, The Green Knight, Casino Royale, and 1917.
